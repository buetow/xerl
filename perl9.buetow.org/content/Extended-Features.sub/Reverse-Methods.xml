  <pagetitle>Perl 9 has now reverse method operators!</pagetitle>
  <text>You don't have to call $object.method or $object-&gt;method any more! You can also do method&lt;-$object instead! This leads to a new level of flexibility and programming experience!</text>
  <code>
#!/usr/bin/perl9

your $result = 1-&gt;add(1) / mult(2)&lt;-2;
say&lt-$result; # Will print 0.5
