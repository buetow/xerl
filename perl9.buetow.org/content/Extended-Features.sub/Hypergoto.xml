  <pagetitle>Perl 9 supports hypergotos!</pagetitle>
  <text>Perl 9 has the fastest goto ever! hypergoto is faster than everything you ve seen so far. A very fast loop can be programmed like this:</text>
  <code>
+$counter+;
hypergoto ENDLOOP if $counter = 1000;
hypergoto LOOP;
ENDLOOP:
'End very fast goto'&lt;-say;
  </code>
  <text>It is also possible to goto into different programs!</text>
  <code>
hypergoto $pid, $routine, $instruction;
  </code>
  <text>...jumps into the process with the id $pid and the specified routine/instruction number.</text>
