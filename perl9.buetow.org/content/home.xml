  <pagetitle>Welcome to the website of Perl 9!</pagetitle>
  <text>Perl 9 is the next major release after Perl 6. Perl 8 has been left out because Perl 9 provides too much new features which would not fit into one major version number. Perl 9 combines all features of Perl 5 and Perl 6. This site only demonstrates some additional features over Perl 5 and Perl 6.</text>
