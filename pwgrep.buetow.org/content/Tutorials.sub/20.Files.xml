  <text>Please read the "tutorial for storing passwords" first. Afterwards you may go on with this tutorial. This tutorial expects you to have understood the basics of pwgrep.</text>
  <text>Besides of storing passwords into a single file, pwgrep can also be used for storing a collection of files, which is very usefull for storing certificate files etc. Like passwords, all files stored within pwgrep are encrypted using GPG. The command pwfls will list all files currently stored in your database:</text>

  <text>pwfadd adds a specific file to the database:</text>
  <cimg href="?document=images/8.png"/>
  <cimg href="?document=images/9.png"/>
  <text>pwfls will show you that it has been added successfully:</text>
  <cimg href="?document=images/10.png"/>
  <text>In order to decrypt a specific stored file you have to use pwfcat:</text>
