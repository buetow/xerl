    <noop>Loadbars is a Perl 5 script for Linux that can be used to observe CPU loads of several remote servers at once in real time. It connects with SSH (using SSH public/private key auth) to several servers at once and vizualizes all server CPUs and memory statistics right next each other (either summarized or each core separately). Loadbars is not a tool for collecting CPU loads and drawing graphs for later analysis. However, since such tools require a significant amount of time before producing results, Loadbars lets you observe the current state immediately. Loadbars does not remember or record any load information. It just shows the current CPU usages like top or vmstat does.</noop>

    <enumitem>No extra software needed on the remote hosts (only Perl, SSHD and procfs is required). You need SSH access to all servers. All servers need a SSH public key for your user installed.</enumitem>
    <enumitem>IPv4 and IPv6 compatible (due use of OpenSSH client)</enumitem>

  <text>To get started fetch loadbars from the deb repository or via git and run it. You'll install some additional CPAN Modules in order to get it running locally (only if you are using git). All required modules for Loadbars 0.7.x are available in Debian Wheezy. Loadbars up to 0.6.x also runs on Squeeze.</text>
